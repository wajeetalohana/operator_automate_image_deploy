# operator-automate-deploy
Automate image deployment using operator sdk pattern

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Build and deploy operator

```sh
make deploy 
```

2. Use sample config file to deploy image.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_project.yaml
```

3. Check the deployment :

```sh
kubectl get deployment
```


4. Update config file, change size (Optional) In order to varify operator:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_project.yaml

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```
